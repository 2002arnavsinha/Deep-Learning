This project focuses on building and refining a machine learning model to classify satellite images as containing ships or not. Using TensorFlow/Keras, the project explores different neural network architectures, including simple classification heads, fully connected layers, dropout layers, and activation function variations. The study involves preprocessing image data, training various models, and evaluating their accuracy, loss, and generalization capabilities. The results highlight the impact of architectural choices on model performance, with the best models achieving around 90% accurac
